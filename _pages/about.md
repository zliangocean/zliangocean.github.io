I am a marine biogeochemist by training. I am interested in observing, understanding and  predicting changes in the ocean system. My current research involves the use of lab analysis of inorganic and organic nutrients collected from worldwide and physical-biogeochemical models.

Research Interests
======
1. Nutrient cycling in the global ocean 
1. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP)
1. Global biogeochemical inverse modeling 
1. Ocean data science
