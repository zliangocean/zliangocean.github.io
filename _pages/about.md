I am a chemical oceanographer by training. I combined both lab and model work to understand and  predict changes in the ocean system, especially for the nutrient biogeochemistry. I collected and analyzed inorganic and organic nutrients (dissolved organic nitrogen/phosphorus) in seawater samples from the global ocean, compiled dissolved organic phosphorus concentrations into a global database and made inverse physical-biogeochemical models to assimilate these observations.I also like play with ocean data from different sources (e.g. MODIS, BGC-ARGO floats).

Research Interests
======
1. Nutrient cycling in the global ocean 
1. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP)
1. Global biogeochemical inverse modeling 
1. Ocean data science
