I am a chemical oceanographer by training. I am interested in observing, understanding and  predicting changes in the ocean system. My current research involves the use of lab analysis of inorganic and organic nutrients from samples collected from worldwide and physical-biogeochemical models.My workflow applies the data science techniques into the ocean science.

Research Interests
======
1. Nutrient cycling in the global ocean 
1. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP)
1. Global biogeochemical inverse modeling 
1. Ocean data science
